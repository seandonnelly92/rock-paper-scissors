/* Instructions
Begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.

As a user:

I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.
I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.
I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.
I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after 10 rounds.
The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

Follow your pseudocode as much as you can, and if you get stuck don't worry, this is a challenging assignment.

ðŸ’¡ Notes 

PSEUDOCODE 

Computer must be able to randomly respond with a value of Rock Paper or Scissors

This needs to be a container with potential answers... I think. I'll call it a variable called 'computerSelection'.

This computerSelection will need to be sent back to the user, with an IF statement. 

No matter what the user does, the computer will need to generate a random computerSelection. 

But the response message should differ based on whether the computer wins or the user wins. 

I'm not sure it's more efficient for the response message to be it's own container with "win", "lose" "draw" or if there should just be loads of messages for each if statement. Probably the former.

Each option has equal chance of win-lose-draw. 

Reponse messages to Rock (all prompts)
- rock-rock: Rock! Draw. Neither of our rocks could smash the other... Try again.
- rock-paper: Paper! You lose, too bad! You must have rocks for brains too. Feckin' eejit. Try again, ya useless eejit.
- rock-scissors. Scissors! Ahhh. You've smashed my scissors apart. You win. I hope you're happy. Double or quits? 

Response messages to Paper (all prompts)
- paper-rock: Rock! :( My rock is covered and suffocated. You win. Fancy another? 
- paper-scissors: Scissors! My scissors cut you into pieces. You LOSE! Ha! Wanna try again?
- paper-paper: Paper! Bore draw. 

Response messages to Scissors (all prompts)
- scissors-scissors: Scissors! Bore draw. Fancy another? 
- scissors-paper: Paper! Oh no. You've cut me up. Let's go again.
- scissors-rock: Rock! SMASH SMASH SMASH. I win. Try again if you dare... 

Program:

The program should ask the user to type their input
PHASE 1
User is prompted to enter Rock, Paper or Scissors. Let's call that userInput

PHASE 2
We transform that variable to lower case for comparison purposes: let userInputLowerCase = userInput.toLowerCase(); 

PHASE 3
The program should generate a random choice also for the computer. We'll create a new variable for that called response. I don't know how to do this yet but for now I'll just make it rock. 

PHASE 4 
The program should run through 3 IF statements for each possible option. To do that, we need to find out what path they're on.

IF userInputLowerCase = rock
    IF computerSelection = rock 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = paper 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = scissors  
        alert = x
    
IF userInputLowerCase = paper
    IF computerSelection = rock 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = paper 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = scissors  
        alert = x
    
IF userInputLowerCase = scissors
    IF computerSelection = rock 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = paper 
        alert = x
    
    IF computerSelection = scissors  
        alert = x
    
ELSE alert = "Oops! You must enter Rock, Paper or Scissors only."
